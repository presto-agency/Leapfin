              Going IPO means you have to grow up. You need to go through public company motions and you are held
              responsible for the accuracy of your financial statements. Audits are no joke, so your revenue data needs
              to be clean and accurate.

              Here comes a messy situation. You need to maintain new integration endpoints and revenue data sets while
