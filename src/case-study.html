            <h3>
              The Challenge:
            </h3>
            <p>
              Canva’s rapid growth had their finance team playing catch-up. Enormous transaction volume, growing
              business
              complexity, and siloed financial data made it difficult for finance to accurately report revenue numbers.
              Damien Singh, Canva’s Chief Financial Officer, knew that their revenue recognition process needed to scale
              to
              support Canva’s rapid growth. Damien understood that along with the company's continued growth came
              demands
              for more sophisticated and timely reporting.
            </p>
            <p>
              The speed of Canva’s rapid global expansion also created new challenges for the finance team who needed to
              be
              prepared to support continued exponential growth while maintaining accuracy in their financial statements.
              As the company continued to grow, siloed and inaccessible data became another challenge. “Some payment
              providers provided only summarised and standardised reporting,” said Damien. Transaction-level reports
              were
              not always available and the format would vary between each payment provider.
            </p>
            <p>
              Managing multiple payment gateways made the month-end close process increasingly complex. Canva’s internal
              systems provided some transaction-level data, but the volume overwhelmed Excel and forced accounting to
              revert
              to summary-level reporting there too. This inaccessible data left accounting vulnerable to surprises at
              month-end.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="editor__content">
            <h3>
              The Solution:
            </h3>
            <p>
              Canva was searching for a partner that had both accounting and technical systems expertise. <a href="#">Leapfin was
              experienced</a> in both areas and acted as a partner and consultant.
            </p>
            <p>
              Leapfin performed a detailed data assessment in order to understand Canva’s unique business problem. The
              data assessment involved gathering stakeholders from finance and engineering to fully understand business
              priorities, systems challenges, and data infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
              To avoid estimates, each of Canva’s hundreds of millions of transactions per year needed to be treated
              independently. Since Leapfin specializes in processing high volumes of transaction-level data, the
              approach was straightforward. For each transaction, Leapfin automatically applies accounting rules and
              generates journal entries. This precision-at-scale was critical for the Canva team.
            </p>
            <p>
              Canva needed easy access to a single source-of-truth for revenue data. Leapfin’s pre-built integrations
              with Apple, Google, and payment providers gave them a head start. Where finance used to rely on delayed
              summary-level reports, Leapfin ingests transaction-level data on a daily basis. To complete the picture,
              Leapfin’s implementation team quickly designed a custom API integration with Canva’s internal billing
              system. With everything in one place, Canva’s finance team can login to Leapfin at any time to proactively
              address problems before month-end.
            </p>
            <p>
              Leapfin continuously works with Canva’s finance team team to meet new and growing requirements. “When
              adding new payment gateways, it’s always an open conversation on let’s have a look and see. It’s never no,
              we can’t support that,” said Damien.

              <em>Accurate revenue reporting</em>
            </strong></p>
            <p>
              Leapfin eliminated estimates in financial reporting. For the first time ever, revenue did not need to be
              adjusted after month-end because it was already accurate. Since Leapfin operates at the transaction-level,
              Canva can disaggregate revenue and report by country, product, platform, and more. “Without Leapfin, we
              wouldn’t be able to know that APAC revenue grew x% Q1 to Q2,” explained Damien, “Now, we can substantiate
              initiatives in any region of the world and show the results in our final reports.” Canva's reports to
              investors provide all the detail they need with minimal risk of misstatement.

            </strong></p>
            <p>
              Leapfin drastically improved the ease of audit and lifted a tremendous burden from Canva’s finance team so
              that they can focus their efforts elsewhere. After receiving Leapfin login access, auditors were able to
              go into Leapfin and perform sample testing without needing to request files from the finance team. Leapfin
              is intuitive so auditors could trace payments to Stripe and gain comfort from 3rd party sources.

            </h3>
            <p>
              “We like to work with companies on a similar journey to Canva,” said Damien. Leapfin is a proud partner of
              Canva and serves as a solid foundation for Canva’s continued growth. As of September 2021, Canva surpassed
              more than 65 million monthly active users and continues to double annualized revenue. Canva has become the
              collaboration platform of choice for millions of teams and workplaces in more than 190 countries.
