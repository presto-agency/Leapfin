      <h3>
        Are flexible pricing options for subscriptions and the back office really at odds with each other?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I sat down with Andrei Rebrov, Chief Technology Officer and Co-founder of Scentbird, and Dan Burkhart, CEO of
        Recurly to discuss what customer-centric pricing looks like for subscription business models. We also discuss
        how subscription companies can balance customer flexibility requests and reporting requirements.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What do your subscribers expect from their subscription?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Andrei: That's a good question. When we started our original offering back in 2015, you could 100% customize
        your subscription. At the time, it was different from other subscription boxes where you would get exactly the
        same thing as every other subscriber.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="#">Nowadays, </a>customization is the norm. Most subscription boxes offer the ability to personalize
        your box. I’ve also seen in the past couple of years that customers want responsible products, shipments,
        operations, and communications.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ray: </strong>I agree. I feel like we’re seeing transformation across the board with both B2C and B2B
        companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the B2C companies we work with, we hear all the time that their customers want to buy the way they want to
        buy and want pricing flexibility. Rather than paying a set price, customers want to pay as you go. The problem
        is that having so much customization creates an operational nightmare for finance and accounting.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dan:</strong> Creating tailored subscriptions for customers is also something that we’re seeing at
        Recurly. I like to think of it like this: 12 years ago, subscriptions were something you’d charge on an annual
        basis. But, customers want to create their own subscription experiences and choose not only what they buy but
        also when they pay.

        Suppose Zappos sold a pair of shoes in June for $100. The total cost of producing the shoes is $60. The company

      <h3>
        The notion of value-based pricing is a concept that's gaining popularity. Are you seeing this trend in your businesses?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Andrei:</strong> As I mentioned, at first, we only had one monthly subscription plan. Now, we have about six different kinds of plans plus multiple add-ons and configurations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, it creates a whole lot of complexity for the finance department. But we are here to satisfy customers. If customers want it, why not do it?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ray: </strong>What’s great for customer experience is basically the opposite of what’s great for finance, accounting, and the operational side of the business.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more flexibility we offer customers, the more complexity for all the various business operations like revenue recognition, order-to-cash reconciliations, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        I always joke with a lot of our customers that we absolutely want to offer the best possible experience. At the same time,
        <strong>we need to make sure that we don’t break the back-office functions. Finding the right balance is incredibly
          challenging but incredibly important as you scale.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Dan: When we started our business, we heard all the time from our customers that they needed to bill on the first of the month because that's what their finance and accounting department wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why do they want to do that rather than having a rolling anniversary date? Being customer-centric means billing should not encumber the user experience.
      </p>
      <h3>
        How do you balance growing at scale vs. doing so efficiently? Have metrics you've defined changed over time?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Andrei: I would love to have five-set metrics that we always look at and never change, but, unfortunately, it doesn’t work that way. We live in a very dynamic world and we have to adapt. We're always asking ourselves: Do we understand what’s going on?
      </p>
      <p>
        If the answer is no, then we have to reassess the metrics we’re looking at and find ones that work.
      </p>
      <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
        <p>
          While our 40% margin is standard for our industry, our competitors are outperforming us with 50%+ margins on similar products. We know that there is consumer demand so how do we improve our margins?
        </p>
        <p>
          Should we increase marketing efforts and focus on pushing higher-margin products? We're getting better rates from our vendors so what if we promote the newer arrivals first so that we can sell the products with the lower cost first (assuming a FIFO inventory method)?
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's chat with marketing regarding new campaigns and with supply chain to ensure we can handle the added shipping volume without excessive delays in light of the pandemic.
